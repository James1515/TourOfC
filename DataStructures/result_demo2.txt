Creating a stack with 10 items...
Stack is empty.
Pushing 3 into the stack.
Pushing 5 into the stack.
Pushing 7 into the stack.
Pushing 9 into the stack.
Pushing 11 into the stack.
Pushing 13 into the stack.

 Now the stack looks like this: [3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
The top element of the stack is currently: 13
Popping two items from the stack... 
The top element is now: 9
